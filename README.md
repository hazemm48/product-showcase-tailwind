# Product Showcase using tailwind

A simple e-commerce product showcase using React + Vite and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to practice and showcase the use of Tailwind CSS in a React application. By building a product showcase, we aim to:

- Gain hands-on experience with Tailwind's utility-first approach
- Explore responsive design techniques using Tailwind classes
- Implement a modern, clean UI efficiently with minimal custom CSS
- Demonstrate the integration of Tailwind with React components

This project serves as a practical exercise in leveraging Tailwind CSS to create a visually appealing and responsive e-commerce interface.

## How to Load the App

The project uses Node.js and the Vite starter. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hazemm48/product-showcase-tailwind.git
cd product-showcase-tailwind
npm install
```
After all dependencies have been installed, you can launch the app with:
```sh
npm run dev
```
A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:5174/](http://localhost:5174/) in your browser.
