Sure, here's an improved version of your README content for your GitHub project:

# Sales-box Task

A simple e-commerce product task using React + Vite and Tailwind CSS.

## Packages Used:

- **clsx**: For writing clean and maintainable class names.
- **swiper.js**: For creating a photo gallery swiper.
- **iconsax-react**: For icons; chosen for its lightweight nature and easy customization with different colors and sizes.

## Features

I have implemented all the task requirements along with some additional features to demonstrate attention to detail:
1. The like and save buttons are clickable.
2. The photo gallery slider auto-scrolls when changing the color.

This task was somewhat challenging as it was my first time using Tailwind CSS. Previously, I relied on Bootstrap and plain CSS. However, after completing this task, I plan to continue learning Tailwind CSS due to its powerful and customizable nature.

### Issues Faced

I encountered an issue with prerendering background colors, which stemmed from how Tailwind renders its classes. The solution I found involved predefining colors in my code, as shown in the `colorVariants.js` file.

## How to Load the App

The project uses Node.js and the Vite starter. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hazemm48/sales-box-task.git
cd sales-box-task
npm install
```
After all dependencies have been installed, you can launch the app with:
```sh
npm run dev
```
A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:5174/](http://localhost:5174/) in your browser.
